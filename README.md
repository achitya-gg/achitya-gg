## 🔭 Current Focus

I'm building **Eden Sphere** — a fully autonomous, AI-powered closed-loop agricultural system designed for extreme environments and off-Earth use.  
I'm also developing flight systems, embedded hardware, and propulsion engines, all self-funded and published in open access journals and arXiv.
